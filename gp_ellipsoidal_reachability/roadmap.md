## Roadmap

#### `Cart_Pole System`
- [x] dynamics
- [ ] constraints
- [x] gaussian angle to gaussian cos/sin representation (see PILCO)
- [ ] Find stabilizing LQR setting
- [ ] Check dynamics (might be wrong right now)

#### `SafeMPC`
- [ ] performance and safety trajectory share multiple controls
- [ ] implement kim wabersich (zeilinger) approach 
- [ ] custom cost function


#### 'GPs'
- [ ] addition and multiplication of kernels and their casadi representations
- [ ] kernel and hyperparameter specification in config instead of GP class
